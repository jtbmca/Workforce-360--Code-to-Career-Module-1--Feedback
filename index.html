                    <p>“Will the video open in a new tab, and you will need to go back to the open class tab in your browser?” 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This sentence appears to be written by a displaced time traveler, and as such, is from a future where causal relations affect English differently and new verb tenses have been invented. Of course, this could be easily fixed by changing the order of “you” and “will”. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                    Instead, I think the question would be clearer if it read, “True or False: After viewing a video in a new tab, must you return to the MCA Open Class Tab in your browser?” and change the answers accordingly. 
                         <br>
                         <br>
                    Furthermore, the lesson portion should read, “The video will open in a new tab. Once the video is complete, you must <s>continue</s> <strong>return</strong> to the MCA Open Class tab”, regardless of which approach is taken as the learner is not actually “continuing” down that branch of research, it ends when the video closes.</p>

In today's vernacular, (regardless of whether boomers or Gen X agree,) "Hello", "Hi", and "Hey" are all interchangeable. At work and personally, I receive many sales and marketing emails that begin with "hey". While Girdler only says "hello", or "hi", it is implied that being less formal is better, as we will see in the next example. if a student were to take her advice to heart, they may very well steer away from the "dear [name]" answer and towards the imperfect "hey [name]" answer as it is closer to what they perceive to be correct.  </p>

One of the her most strict closings is, "warmest regards", which to some would line up with "cheers' more than an answer that contains the more formal, "Sincerely". I think the chance of this being misunderstood is higher for the neurodivergent, the youth, and people who speak English as a second language.
